###Karol Dzitkowski 's result is  as follow.(High Frequency Trading Price Prediction 
###using LSTM Recursive Neural Networks, Karol Dzitkowski)
RNN avg err = 0 . 5 6 7 3 0 0 7 2 4 6 3 8
epsilon = 0.5, SGD optimizer


###After I changed epsilon = 0.9375, optimizer to Adagrad optimizer
###RNN ave err is as follow. 


2nd RNN AVERAGE ERROR = 0.56443236715
RNN TEST ERRORS = [ 0.57669082  0.56219807  0.56944444  0.55193237  0.57789855  0.57246377
  0.57125604  0.57729469  0.57246377  0.5839372   0.55012077  0.57125604
  0.54770531  0.56038647  0.5531401   0.55736715  0.5736715   0.54770531
  0.55495169  0.55676329]

Now, I need to incorporate Seq2Seq and Recurrent Shop in  this program to tune up the performance at next step.
